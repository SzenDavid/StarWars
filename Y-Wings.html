View git diffs directly in atom.

Please note this package will show one diff at a time, as opposed to all diffs at once (see #58).

Keybindings
alt-g alt-d to toggle the diff view (You'll need to press these keys one after another, and you'll need to place the cursor on a line that is marked as a diff)
escape to close the diff view
alt-u for undo
alt-c for copy
Syntax highlighting
You can choose whether the diff should be highlighted or not:

Styling
You can style the diffs to your liking. Here's an example:

atom-text-editor::shadow .line {
 &.git-diff-details-new-highlighted {
   background-color: rgba(162, 232, 120, 0.4) !important;
 }

 &.git-diff-details-old-highlighted {
   background-color: rgba(232, 120, 120, 0.4) !important;
 }

 &.git-diff-details-new-flat {
   background-color: rgba(162, 232, 120, 0.7) !important;
 }

 &.git-diff-details-old-flat {
   background-color: rgba(232, 120, 120, 0.7) !important;
 }
}
